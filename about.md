The Trucker Codex Blog is a compliance-focused knowledge base for owner-operators and small fleets operating under U.S. DOT and FMCSA rules.

We publish practical, audit-oriented guidance on the documents, retention habits, and operational routines that reduce compliance risk during roadside inspections, safety reviews, and enforcement actions.

## What You’ll Find Here

- DOT compliance fundamentals (what is required vs. what is recommended)
- FMCSA-aligned documentation systems (DQF, maintenance, inspections, records)
- Clear explanations of high-risk areas that frequently trigger violations
- Checklist-driven workflows designed for real-world operations

## Important Note

This blog provides general informational content. It does not constitute legal advice, and it does not replace official FMCSA guidance or professional counsel.
