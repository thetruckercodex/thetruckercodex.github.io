### 1. The Nature of The Trucker Codex
The Trucker Codex is a technical, didactic, and analytical platform dedicated to providing up-to-date data on DOT and FMCSA regulatory frameworks. Our primary objective is to simplify complex 2025–2026 mandates for fleet managers and industry professionals.

### 2. What We Are (And What We Are Not)
* **Educational Resource:** This platform is an independent information hub.
* **No Professional-Client Relationship:** Using this site or purchasing digital products does not create an attorney-client or a certified consultancy-client relationship.
* **Not Legal Advice:** The content provided here—including guides on DQF, SFD, and recordkeeping—is for **informational purposes only** and does not constitute legal or professional advice.

### 3. Seek Authorized Guidance
While we strive for technical perfection and rely on verified data, the transportation industry is governed by complex federal and state laws that are subject to rapid change. 
* **Consult Experts:** For official audits, binding compliance decisions, or specific legal disputes, you must consult with a **licensed attorney** or a **legally authorized safety consultant**. 
* **Official Sources:** Always cross-reference operational decisions with official government portals at **FMCSA.gov** and **DOT.gov**.

### 4. Limitation of Liability
**The Trucker Codex** and its parent entity, **Atelier 52 LLC**, shall not be held liable for any direct, indirect, or incidental damages, penalties, or fines resulting from the use or interpretation of the information provided on this platform. Compliance is the sole responsibility of the carrier and the individual professional.

### 5. Privacy & Data Integrity
We respect the privacy of our professional audience:
* **Google Analytics (GA4):** We use GA4 to analyze engagement and optimize content based on user behavior (e.g., desktop vs. mobile usage).
* **No Third-Party Sales:** We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.
* **Etsy Storefront:** Links to our [Etsy Shop](https://thetruckercodex.etsy.com) are secure; however, external sites have their own privacy policies for which we are not responsible.
