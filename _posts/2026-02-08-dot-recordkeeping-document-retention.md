DOT recordkeeping and document retention requirements are a foundational part of FMCSA compliance. Even when drivers operate safely, missing or improperly retained documents can result in violations during roadside inspections and audits.

FMCSA enforcement is documentation-driven. Carriers and drivers must be able to produce required records on demand.

## What Is DOT Recordkeeping?

DOT recordkeeping refers to the creation, maintenance, and retention of compliance documents required by FMCSA regulations. These records demonstrate that drivers, vehicles, and operations meet federal safety standards.

Required records typically include driver qualification files, hours-of-service logs, vehicle inspection and maintenance records, and supporting documents related to daily operations. Records must be accurate, current, and organized.

## How Long Must Records Be Retained?

FMCSA regulations specify retention periods for different types of records. Some documents must be retained for months, while others must be kept for several years.

Driver qualification records must be retained for as long as the driver is employed and for a required period afterward. Vehicle maintenance records must be retained for a defined period after the vehicle leaves service. Hours-of-service records must be retained and readily accessible for inspection.

Failure to retain records for the required duration is treated as a compliance violation, regardless of whether the underlying activity was compliant.

## How Recordkeeping Is Enforced

Recordkeeping compliance is enforced through roadside inspections, safety audits, and compliance reviews. Inspectors and auditors verify that required records exist, are complete, and are retained for the appropriate time period.

Inconsistent or missing documentation often triggers expanded audits because it indicates weak compliance controls. Poor recordkeeping is frequently cited as evidence of systemic non-compliance.

## Common Recordkeeping Violations

Common recordkeeping violations include missing documents, expired records, inconsistent data between logs and supporting documents, and failure to retain records for the required period.

Many violations occur because records are not reviewed regularly or are stored in a disorganized manner. Effective recordkeeping requires consistent review, clear retention policies, and organized storage systems.
