DOT vehicle inspection and maintenance requirements are a core part of FMCSA compliance for commercial motor vehicles. These rules exist to ensure that trucks operating on public roads are safe, properly maintained, and free of defects that could cause accidents or mechanical failures.

Failure to comply with inspection and maintenance requirements is a common cause of roadside violations, audit findings, and out-of-service orders.

## What Are DOT Vehicle Inspection Requirements?

FMCSA regulations require commercial motor vehicles to be systematically inspected, repaired, and maintained. Drivers must perform pre-trip and post-trip inspections to identify safety-related defects or deficiencies.

Any defect that could affect the safe operation of the vehicle must be documented and corrected before the vehicle is operated again. Inspection reports must be accurate and complete, as they are frequently reviewed during roadside inspections.

These inspection requirements apply to power units and, when applicable, trailers operated under a carrier’s authority.

## Maintenance and Repair Recordkeeping

In addition to inspections, carriers must maintain detailed records of vehicle maintenance and repairs. Maintenance records must identify the vehicle, describe the work performed, and document when repairs were completed.

These records must be retained for the period required by FMCSA regulations and be made available during compliance reviews and audits. Missing or incomplete maintenance documentation is treated as a compliance failure, even if the vehicle appears to be in good condition.

## How Inspections and Maintenance Are Enforced

Vehicle inspection and maintenance compliance is enforced through roadside inspections, safety audits, and compliance reviews. Inspectors may place vehicles out of service if critical defects are discovered or if required documentation is missing.

Repeated inspection failures or maintenance deficiencies increase the likelihood of further enforcement actions and audits. Poor vehicle maintenance records can also contribute to negative safety ratings.

## Common Vehicle Compliance Failures

Common violations include failure to conduct required inspections, operating vehicles with known defects, and inadequate maintenance records. In many cases, violations occur because inspection reports are not reviewed or repairs are not documented properly.

Maintaining inspection and maintenance compliance requires consistent inspection routines, timely repairs, and organized documentation. Vehicle condition and maintenance records are a fundamental component of DOT compliance.
