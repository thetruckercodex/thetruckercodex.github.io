Most roadside maintenance violations come from missing structure, not rare mechanical failures. A documented inspection-and-repair routine aligned to 49 CFR Part 396 reduces OOS risk and repeat inspections.

## Introduction

Vehicle inspection and maintenance compliance is governed primarily by **49 CFR Part 396**, which establishes systematic inspection, repair, and maintenance requirements for commercial motor vehicles.

Failure to maintain structured maintenance oversight frequently results in roadside violations, Out-of-Service orders, and audit exposure.

---

## Regulatory Framework

Under 49 CFR Part 396, motor carriers and owner-operators must:

- Systematically inspect, repair, and maintain vehicles  
- Maintain records of inspections and repairs  
- Conduct annual vehicle inspections  
- Ensure defects are corrected before operation  

The regulation emphasizes documented maintenance discipline, not reactive repairs.

---

## Common Maintenance Enforcement Findings

Roadside inspections frequently identify:

- Brake adjustment deficiencies  
- Tire tread depth violations  
- Inoperative lighting systems  
- Missing annual inspection documentation  

Brake-related risks are addressed in our [Brake System Violations Guide](/brake-system-violations-out-of-service/).

Tire enforcement standards are detailed in our [Tire Defects and OOS Criteria](/tire-defects-out-of-service-criteria/).

## Enforcement Impact

Maintenance failures may lead to:

- Immediate vehicle Out-of-Service orders  
- CSA Vehicle Maintenance BASIC score impact  
- Repair costs and operational downtime  
- Increased inspection frequency  

Repeated maintenance violations signal systemic oversight deficiencies rather than isolated mechanical failures.

---

## Preventive Maintenance Controls

To reduce enforcement exposure:

1. Implement measurable pre-trip inspections.  
2. Maintain documented repair records.  
3. Schedule periodic mechanical reviews.  
4. Track annual inspection deadlines.  
5. Address minor defects before regulatory thresholds are met.

Maintenance compliance should be treated as a structured operational system, not an occasional check.
