Hours-of-Service violations are one of the fastest ways to get a driver placed out of service during a roadside inspection. This guide breaks down the most common triggers, what officers look for, and the controls that prevent repeat violations.

## Introduction

Hours-of-Service (HOS) violations are among the most common driver-related Out-of-Service (OOS) triggers during roadside inspections. Under [49 CFR Part 395](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-49/subtitle-B/chapter-III/subchapter-B/part-395), commercial drivers must comply with strict limits on driving time, duty periods, and required rest breaks.

Unlike minor paperwork errors, certain HOS violations can immediately place a driver out of service, resulting in operational disruption and compliance consequences.

For a foundational overview of HOS requirements, see our [Hours-of-Service Rules Guide](/hours-of-service-rules/).

## What Triggers an HOS Out-of-Service Order

During a roadside inspection, officers review Electronic Logging Device (ELD) records or Record of Duty Status (RODS) entries. Common OOS-triggering violations include:

- **Exceeding the 11-hour driving limit**
- **Exceeding the 14-hour duty window**
- **Failing to take the required 30-minute break** (when applicable)
- **False or materially inaccurate log entries**

If a driver is found to be operating beyond allowable limits, enforcement may require an immediate off-duty period before the vehicle can continue.

> **Note:** Intent is not required for enforcement. Even unintentional miscalculations can result in OOS status.

## Enforcement and Operational Impact

An HOS-related OOS order may result in:

- **Immediate shutdown** for a mandatory rest period
- **Delivery delays** and missed appointment windows
- **CSA impact** (Driver-related safety exposure)
- **Elevated inspection frequency**

Repeated violations increase regulatory scrutiny and can negatively influence safety profiles and insurance risk assessments.

Driver-related violations often appear alongside vehicle-related findings, such as those discussed in our [Brake System Violations Guide](/brake-system-violations-out-of-service/).

## Why HOS Violations Occur

Common contributing factors include:

- Misunderstanding **split-sleeper provisions**
- Improper **ELD duty-status selection** or edits
- Failure to monitor remaining drive time in real time
- Pressure from tight delivery schedules

Drivers sometimes rely on estimated remaining time rather than actively tracking available hours. Enforcement relies on recorded log data and compliance thresholds, not subjective estimates.

## Preventive Compliance Controls

To reduce HOS-related enforcement exposure:

1. **Monitor available drive time in real time** (don’t “guess” remaining hours).
2. **Understand split-sleeper rules** and any applicable exceptions before using them.
3. **Verify ELD entries** at the end of each duty period.
4. **Avoid manual log corrections** without documentation.
5. **Plan routes** with realistic buffer time.

Driver compliance should be managed as part of an integrated system alongside documentation requirements such as [Driver Qualification File (DQF) Requirements](/driver-qualification-file-requirements/).
