Common DOT violations are rarely caused by a single serious mistake. In most cases, violations result from repeated documentation errors, inconsistent records, or failure to follow basic compliance procedures.

Understanding the most frequent violations—and why they occur—allows drivers and carriers to reduce enforcement risk before it escalates.

## Hours of Service and Logging Violations

Hours of Service (HOS) violations are among the most frequently cited DOT violations. These include exceeding driving limits, failing to take required rest periods, and maintaining inaccurate or incomplete logs.

Electronic Logging Device (ELD) data is routinely reviewed during inspections, and inconsistencies between logs and supporting documents often result in citations. Regular log review and prompt correction of errors are essential for avoiding HOS violations.

## Driver Qualification File Deficiencies

Incomplete or outdated Driver Qualification Files (DQFs) are a common audit finding. Missing medical certificates, expired motor vehicle records, and incomplete employment histories frequently trigger violations.

DQF violations are particularly risky because they suggest that drivers were not properly qualified at the time they operated a commercial vehicle. Regular review and updating of DQFs is critical for maintaining compliance.

For DQF requirements, see:
[Driver Qualification File (DQF): Requirements Explained](/driver-qualification-file-requirements/)

## Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Issues

Vehicle-related violations often involve failure to conduct required inspections, operating vehicles with unresolved defects, or inadequate maintenance documentation. Even minor defects can result in out-of-service orders if they affect vehicle safety.

Maintenance records must accurately reflect inspection results and repairs performed. Missing or inconsistent maintenance documentation is treated as a compliance failure during audits.

## Recordkeeping and Documentation Failures

Recordkeeping violations occur when required documents are missing, retained for insufficient periods, or inconsistent across records. Documentation discrepancies frequently lead inspectors to expand the scope of audits.

Effective recordkeeping requires organized storage, consistent review, and awareness of retention requirements. Documentation quality plays a central role in DOT enforcement outcomes.

Reducing DOT violations requires treating compliance as an ongoing operational process. Drivers and carriers who proactively review records, address deficiencies, and maintain organized documentation are better positioned to avoid enforcement actions.
