ELD compliance is primarily a process problem: how logs are reviewed, corrected, and supported—not whether a device is installed. Log accuracy failures can trigger roadside violations and audit escalation.

## Introduction

Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs) are regulated under **49 CFR Part 395**, which governs Hours-of-Service compliance. ELD errors, inaccurate entries, or misuse can trigger roadside violations and Out-of-Service determinations.

ELD compliance is not limited to device installation; it requires accurate operational management.

---

## Core Compliance Requirements

ELD compliance includes:

- Accurate recording of duty status  
- Proper annotation of edits  
- Retention of required records  
- Transfer capability during roadside inspection  

Drivers remain responsible for log accuracy even when using automated systems.

---

## Common Enforcement Findings

Roadside inspections frequently identify:

- Unassigned driving time  
- Failure to certify logs  
- Improper use of personal conveyance  
- Exceeding drive time limits  

Drive time exceedances are discussed in our [Hours-of-Service Violations Guide](/hours-of-service-violations-out-of-service/).

## Enforcement Impact

ELD-related violations may result in:

- Immediate driver Out-of-Service orders  
- CSA Driver BASIC score impact  
- Audit review triggers  
- Increased inspection frequency  

Repeated log accuracy issues signal systemic compliance weaknesses.

## Preventive Compliance Controls

To reduce ELD-related enforcement exposure:

1. Review log entries daily.  
2. Understand exception provisions before use.  
3. Resolve unassigned drive time promptly.  
4. Retain required documentation supporting edits.  
5. Train drivers on regulatory limits.

Driver qualification and recordkeeping integration is addressed in our [Driver Qualification File Requirements](/driver-qualification-file-requirements/).
