Between 2025 and 2026, FMCSA and DOT enforcement priorities continue to shift toward data-driven oversight, documentation accuracy, and technology-based compliance. While many core regulations remain unchanged, enforcement focus and operational expectations for drivers and carriers have evolved.

Truck drivers and owner-operators should understand where compliance attention is increasing and which areas present the greatest risk going into 2026.

## Increased Emphasis on Data and Targeted Enforcement

FMCSA continues to rely heavily on inspection data, violation trends, and safety metrics to identify carriers for enforcement actions. Rather than broad, random oversight, enforcement efforts increasingly target carriers that exhibit repeat patterns of non-compliance.

This means that individual violations—especially those related to hours of service, vehicle condition, and documentation—are more likely to contribute to follow-up audits and reviews. Consistency across records has become as important as the records themselves.

## Documentation Accuracy and Recordkeeping Expectations

Recordkeeping remains a central enforcement priority. FMCSA enforcement in 2025–2026 places greater scrutiny on whether required documents are complete, current, and internally consistent.

Driver qualification files, hours-of-service records, and vehicle maintenance documentation are frequently reviewed together to identify discrepancies. Missing or outdated records continue to be treated as compliance failures, even when operations appear otherwise safe.

## Technology-Driven Compliance Oversight

Electronic logging devices (ELDs) remain a primary enforcement tool, and inspectors increasingly expect drivers to demonstrate basic ELD operation and data transfer capability. Malfunctions, unreviewed logs, and certification issues remain common sources of violations.

Technology-based oversight also increases the visibility of patterns over time. Repeated minor issues may collectively signal non-compliance, even if no single violation appears severe.

## What Drivers Should Prioritize in 2026

As enforcement priorities evolve, drivers should focus on maintaining accurate records, reviewing inspection results, and addressing deficiencies promptly. Compliance in 2026 is less about reacting to enforcement and more about preventing patterns that attract scrutiny.

Carriers and owner-operators who treat compliance as a continuous operational process—rather than a one-time requirement—are better positioned to reduce enforcement risk.
