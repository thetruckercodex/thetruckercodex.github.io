## Introduction

DOT compliance audits are not random events. They are typically triggered by identifiable risk indicators, inspection history patterns, or documented safety concerns. Understanding what initiates an audit allows carriers and owner-operators to manage exposure proactively.

---

## Common Audit Triggers

Compliance reviews may be initiated due to:

- Repeated roadside violations  
- Elevated CSA BASIC scores  
- Crash history trends  
- Complaints or whistleblower reports  
- Failure to maintain required documentation  

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) outlines safety oversight responsibilities under **49 CFR Part 385**, which governs Safety Fitness Procedures.

---

## The Role of CSA Data

CSA scores aggregate inspection findings across multiple categories, including:

- Vehicle Maintenance  
- Hours-of-Service Compliance  
- Driver Fitness  

Repeated violations in any BASIC category increase the likelihood of audit scrutiny.

Vehicle-related enforcement risk is detailed in our [Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Requirements Guide](/dot-vehicle-inspection-maintenance-requirements/).

---

## Enforcement Consequences

An audit may result in:

- Notice of Violation  
- Notice of Claim (civil penalties)  
- Required corrective action plans  
- Safety rating downgrades  

Documentation failures during audit review frequently involve Driver Qualification Files and recordkeeping gaps.

These documentation standards are covered in our [Driver Qualification File Requirements](/driver-qualification-file-requirements/).

---

## Preventive Controls

To reduce audit exposure:

1. Monitor CSA performance trends.  
2. Conduct internal compliance reviews quarterly.  
3. Maintain organized documentation systems.  
4. Correct recurring roadside findings immediately.  
5. Treat minor violations as leading indicators.

Audits are typically the result of accumulated patterns, not isolated events.
