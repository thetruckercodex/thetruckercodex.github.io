On February 10, 2026, PHMSA published HM-215R (Docket PHMSA-2023-0111), initiating a new harmonization cycle for 49 CFR Parts 171-180. On **February 10, 2026**, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) issued a pivotal Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), designated as **Docket ID: PHMSA-2023-0111 (HM-215R)**. This rulemaking aims to harmonize the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR Parts 171-180) with contemporary international standards, including the 23rd Revised Edition of the UN Model Regulations, the IATA/ICAO Technical Instructions, and the IMDG Code. For the sophisticated carrier, HM-215R is not merely a paperwork update; it is a fundamental shift in the technical requirements for shipping names, hazard classes, and packaging protocols.

The Strategic Objective of HM-215R

The primary objective of the HM-215R NPRM is to mitigate the operational risks associated with jurisdictional inconsistencies. When domestic U.S. regulations fall out of sync with international standards, carriers involved in multimodal or cross-border operations face elevated enforcement risks and logistical bottlenecks. 

By aligning with the latest international revisions, PHMSA seeks to enhance safety while reducing the administrative burden on carriers. However, this harmonization necessitates a comprehensive review of existing Safety Operating Procedures (SOPs) and employer training files to ensure that the human element remains as current as the regulatory text.

## Critical Technical Revisions: Lithium Batteries and Packaging

One of the most significant components of the February 2026 NPRM involves the evolution of lithium battery regulations. As global demand for high-capacity energy storage grows, PHMSA is proposing refined standards for the classification and labeling of lithium-ion and lithium-metal cells.

### 1. Lithium Battery Marking and Documentation
The proposed rule introduces adjustments affecting lithium battery marking and associated documentation requirements to maintain consistency with international transport protocols. Carriers must be prepared to identify and verify these marks during the transition period. Furthermore, the NPRM explores enhanced documentation for "excepted" lithium battery shipments, bridging the gap between small-scale retail transport and industrial-scale logistics.



### 2. Proper Shipping Names and Hazard Table Updates
HM-215R proposes numerous amendments to the **§ 172.101 Hazardous Materials Table (HMT)**. These include new entries for specific chemical compounds and updated "Special Provisions" that dictate the type of packaging required. For carriers, this means that software-automated BOL (Bill of Lading) systems must be audited to prevent the use of decommissioned shipping names, which are a primary trigger for violations under the [Audits & Violations](/audits-violations/) framework.

## Operational Implications: Training and Recordkeeping Integrity

Under **49 CFR § 172.704**, hazmat employers are required to provide function-specific training to hazmat employees. The introduction of HM-215R creates an immediate "training trigger." Once the final rule is enacted, carriers will have a limited window to certify that their drivers and dispatchers understand the new classification and packaging requirements.

### Retention Policy Review: 49 CFR § 172.704
Carriers operating under the "The Trucker Codex" philosophy should not wait for the final rule's effective date to begin their internal audits. A proactive approach includes:

- **Recordkeeping Compliance:** To ensure litigation-grade readiness, hazmat training records must be retained for **at least three years from the most recent training date**, and for former employees, for the **duration of employment plus 90 days** thereafter. These records must be available for inspection during a compliance review at any time.
- **Emergency Response Accuracy:** Ensuring that emergency response information (ERI) reflects the updated shipping names to avoid delays during incidents.
- **Separation of Files:** Ensuring HazMat training records are managed within employer training files, distinct from the [Driver Qualification File (DQF)](/dqf/) requirements, though both should be audited under a unified safety management system to prevent compliance gaps.

The failure to harmonize internal SOPs with the 2026 PHMSA shifts increases the likelihood of a high-weight violation during a Level I or Level III inspection, potentially leading to an Out-of-Service (OOS) order under the [2026 CVSA Criteria Updates](/cvsa-2026-oos-criteria-changes/).

## The Public Comment Period: A Thought Leadership Opportunity

As of February 18, 2026, the PHMSA NPRM remains in the public comment phase, with a deadline of **April 13, 2026**. This period represents a strategic window for carriers to influence the final regulatory outcome. PHMSA actively seeks input on the economic impact of these changes and the feasibility of the proposed compliance timelines.

Engaging in the comment process via the [Federal Register (Doc. No. 2026-02575)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2026/02/10/2026-02575/hazardous-materials-harmonization-with-international-standards) allows a carrier to transition from a reactive "rule-taker" to a proactive "thought leader" within the industry. This level of engagement is a hallmark of elite safety management systems.

## Risk Mitigation and Litigation Readiness

In the event of a hazardous materials incident, the regulatory landscape shifts from compliance to litigation. The primary question in a courtroom will be: "Did the carrier exercise the highest degree of care in following the most current federal standards?" 

If a carrier is utilizing SOPs based on outdated harmonization cycles, they are effectively operating in a state of technical non-compliance. By adopting the HM-215R standards early, carriers build a "defensive wall" of documented compliance that is difficult for plaintiff attorneys to penetrate. This is especially critical when dealing with the high severity weights associated with [Recordkeeping & Retention](/recordkeeping-retention/) and HazMat infractions.

## Conclusion: Preparing for the Final Rule

The PHMSA February 2026 Harmonization NPRM is a reminder that the only constant in HazMat transport is change. As the global supply chain becomes more integrated, the HMR must continue to evolve. Carriers that treat HM-215R as a strategic priority will achieve superior safety outcomes, reduced enforcement exposure, and a robust market position.

"The Trucker Codex" approach dictates that we don't just follow the road; we understand the chemistry of the cargo and the geography of the law.
